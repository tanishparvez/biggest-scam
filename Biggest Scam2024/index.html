  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:

2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

  <h1>Biggest Scam in 2024</h1>
  <P>The stock market crash on June 4th likely resulted from a mix of factors like economic data, geopolitical tensions, or unexpected news.
    Investor sentiment likely turned negative, triggering panic selling and high volatility. Governments and central banks likely intervened to stabilize the situation. 
    Understanding investor behavior during the crash and its long-term implications is crucial.
